# Deck Scripts

A collection of helpful scripts to run on the steam deck. So far this list
includes:

- InstallXboxdrvSD: Replace the Xpad driver with Xboxdrv to support
		    controller hotplugging.
- EnableXpad: 	    Stop any running Xboxdrv daemons and re-enable the Xpad
                    driver.
- xboxdrv.service:  An example systemd service file to run xboxdrv at
                    startup.

## Installing xboxdrv
The InstallXboxdrvSD.sh script requires a compiled (doesn't need to be
installed) version of [xboxdrv](https://xboxdrv.gitlab.io/) this can be be
obtained via the ubuntu packages or from the
[source](https://gitlab.com/xboxdrv/xboxdrv/-/tree/stable).

If compiling from the source make sure to use the stable and not the dev
branch. The dev branch does not appear to work with the Steam Deck.

Note: SteamOS is based on Arch and therefore can't use ubuntu packages and I
had trouble compiling on the steam deck itself. I recommend compiling on
another machine first and then transferring to the Steam Deck via a USB or SD
card.

Once xboxdrv has been built and transferred to your Deck, simply update the
XBOXDRV_BIN variable in the InstallXboxdrvSD.sh script with the path of your
xboxdrv binary folder and the script can be run as needed.

## Setting up a systemd service
Setting up a systemd service can be simple by using the provided
xboxdrv.service file. Simply update this service file with the path to the
InstallXboxdrvSD.sh script and then run the following:
```
$ sudo cp <path-to-xboxdrv.service> /etc/systemd/system/
$ sudo systemctl enable xboxdrv.service
```

You can check the service is running correctly by running the following:
```
$ sudo systemctl start xboxdrv.service
$ systemctl status xboxdrv.service
```

## Xboxdrv Configuration
When xboxdrv is setup as a daemon, it needs to be told what controllers to
expect so it can correctly assign slots. Currently 4 Xbox 360 controllers are
assigned, including one which is an Xbox 360 guitar. This setup can be
modified to suit the controllers you have and further details can be found on
the [xboxdrv docs](https://xboxdrv.gitlab.io/xboxdrv.html)
